# Magic the Gathering Deck Building Meta Finder

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is an idea of creating an AI playing Magic the Gathering. Eventually it will also be able to build it's own deck with the goals of winning as many games as possible versus real players.

## Background

#### About the game

Magic: The Gathering has been distributed in several products throughout its history. In a typical year, one core set and three expansions are printed, containing the majority of the new cards.

Wizards of the Coast also publishes digital versions of new sets within current video games. Magic Arena and Magic Online are digital versions of the trading card game, available on Windows. Arena is the newer program and has a stronger focus on Standard while Online is older and covers the Modern area of play.

#### What is the problem my idea will solve?

There might not be an direct problem it will solve, BUT it might help developers adjust cards before they get realeased. This project can help developers gain insight in how they can balance cards, and help players gain insight both in deck building and play.

The main problem the project might face:
* Wizard of the Coast is the game developers will this project be able to continue without their support?

## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

The game developers can run the AI with the new cards that they have came up with, to try and see if there are way to powerful cards before the realease. Players can study how the AI is playing and how it's thinking in terms of probability, mana usage and deck building.


## Data sources and AI methods

| Syntax        | Description |
| -----------   | ----------- |
| Card Database | Can be collected by playing the game, can also come from databases online. |
| Game Rules    | The Developers has this data. | 
| Probability   | 
| Deep Learning | 

## Challenges

It's important that the AI isn't used by players to rank up in the ladder or in drafts, that would be cheating. It's important to make it very detectable and that it gets the developers support.

## What next?

* If this project is going to grow it needs permission and support from the developers.
* It needs developers who can code in python and/or who plays the game

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
