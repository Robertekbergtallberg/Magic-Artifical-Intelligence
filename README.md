# Magic the Gathering Deck Building Meta Finder

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is an idea of creating an AI playing Magic the Gathering. Eventually it will also be able to build it's own deck with the goals of winning as many games as possible versus real players.

## Background

### About the game

Magic: The Gathering has been distributed in several products throughout its history. In a typical year, one core set and three expansions are printed, containing the majority of the new cards.

Wizards of the Coast also publishes digital versions of new sets within current video games. Magic Arena and Magic Online are digital versions of the trading card game, available on Windows. Arena is the newer program and has a stronger focus on Standard while Online is older and covers the Modern area of play.

There will probably be many problems in doing this, so i will not list every problem that comes to my mind. 

This project can help developers gain insight in how they can balance cards, and help players gain insight both in deck building and play.

Problems the project might face:
* Wizard of the Coast is the game developers will this project be able to continue without their support?


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
