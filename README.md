# Magic the Gathering Deck Building Meta Finder

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Magic: The Gathering has been distributed in several products throughout its history. In a typical year, one core set and three expansions are printed, containing the majority of the new cards.

With this project i want to create an AI that can play the game and build it's own deck with the goal to win.


## Background

Which problems does your idea solve? How common or frequent is this problem? What is your personal motivation? Why is this topic important or interesting?

This idea doesn't really solve any problem. It can help developers find cards that will be to overpowered before they are released. It can help players develop their skills in the game. an AI can find things player never thought about, we can see that in the OpenAI in Dota 2 and starcraft 2.

Problems the project might face:
* Magic The Gathering has alot of rules so applying all of them might be very difficult, so applying the most common ones and then let the AI learn the rest is my plan, not sure if this will be a problem thought.
* There is a lot of cards in magic so how do you let the AI learn the cards? will it learn it by playing or will you put all the cards in it's memory?
* 
* etc.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
